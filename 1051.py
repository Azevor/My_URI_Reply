'''
In an imaginary country called Lisarb, all the people are very happy to pay
their taxes because they know that doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians and the
taxes are used to benefit the population, without any misappropriation.
The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.
* view table in URI *
Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary
of a Lisarb inhabitant. Then print the due value that this person must pay of
taxes, according to the table below.

Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, the rate of 8% is only over
R$ 1,000.00, because the salary from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free.
In the follow example, the total rate is 8% over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00,
resulting in R$ 80.36 at all. The answer must be printed with 2 digits after
the decimal point.
